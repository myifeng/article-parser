Djokovic, the world number one and the top seed at the tournament, won 7-5,
6-3 against Argentine Schwartzman to lift his 36th Masters title, one more
than Rafael Nadal.

The Serb said he did not play his best tennis this time in Rome, but could

defending champion Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic retired while
trailing 6-0, 2-1 in the final.
